# Advent of Code 2024
In Rust. Not necessarily polished. Naming convention (naming each problem "example") is weird because I originally started writing code using Rust's `examples` [directory structure](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/project-layout.html)
and then forgot to change it. Last year I got 5 problems in before giving up on Rust, this year I got all the way to 15.
